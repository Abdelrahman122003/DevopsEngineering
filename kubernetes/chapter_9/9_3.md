> # Using Secrets to pass sensitive data to containers

ConfigMaps are not ideal for storing sensitive data like credentials and encryption keys. For secure data, Kubernetes offers a separate object called Secrets

## Introducing Secrets

## Differences in fields between config maps and secrets

- Data Encoding:

  ConfigMaps: Store data as plain text.<br>
  Secrets: Store data encoded in Base64 for additional security.

- Intended Use:

  ConfigMaps: Used for non-sensitive configuration data.<br>
  Secrets: Used for sensitive data like passwords, API keys, and encryption keys.

- Data Access:

  ConfigMaps: Typically mounted as files or environment variables.<br>
  Secrets: Can be mounted as files or environment variables, but often accessed through more secure means.

- Default Behavior:

  ConfigMaps: No additional encryption or security measures.<br>
  Secrets: Kubernetes provides mechanisms to enhance security, such as access controls and encryption at rest.

## Creating a secret

- Using the stringData field

  The stringData field in Secrets is write-only and used to set values. Once created, stringData is not visible when reading the Secret; instead, values appear in the data field as Base64-encoded.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: my-secret
  type: Opaque
  stringData:
    user: my-username
    pass: my-password
  ```

## Using secrets in containers

**Injecting secrets into environment variables**

```yaml
containers:
  - name: my-container
    env:
      - name: TLS_CERT
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: kiada-tls
            key: tls.crt
```
