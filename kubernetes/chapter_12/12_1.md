> # Introducing Ingresses

In Kubernetes, an Ingress is a way for external clients to access the services of applications running in the cluster. The Ingress function consists of the following three components:

- The Ingress API object, which is used to define and configure an ingress.
- An L7 load balancer or reverse proxy that routes traffic to the backend services.
- The ingress controller, which monitors the Kubernetes API for Ingress objects and deploys and configures the load balancer or reverse proxy.

`NOTE`

L4 and L7 refer to layer 4 (Transport Layer; TCP, UDP) and layer 7 (Application Layer; HTTP) of the Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model).

`NOTE`

Unlike a forward proxy, which routes and filters outgoing traffic and is typically located in the same location as the clients it serves, a reverse proxy handles incoming traffic and routes it to one or more backend servers. A reverse proxy is located near those servers.

## Let us remember the load balancer

A LoadBalancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service to ensure high availability and scalability.

LoadBalancer is typically used to distribute traffic to multiple instances of a single application or service, not multiple applications.

## The difference between ingress and loadBalancer

Using an Ingress instead of a LoadBalancer in Kubernetes offers several advantages, especially in terms of flexibility, cost-efficiency, and manageability:

1. Cost Efficiency
   - LoadBalancer: Provisioning a LoadBalancer for each service can become expensive, especially in cloud environments where each LoadBalancer is typically a chargeable resource.
   - Ingress: With Ingress, you can use a single LoadBalancer to handle traffic for multiple services, reducing the number of LoadBalancers required and thus saving costs.
2. Advanced Routing Capabilities

   - LoadBalancer: Typically routes traffic to a single service or set of endpoints without advanced routing rules.
   - Ingress: Supports more complex routing rules, such as directing traffic based on HTTP hostnames, URL paths, and headers. This allows you to serve multiple applications (or versions) under different domains or paths using a single ingress point.

3. Centralized Traffic Management

- LoadBalancer: Each service would need its own LoadBalancer, making it harder to manage and update traffic rules.

  "making it harder to manage and update traffic rules," that is mean If each service has its own LoadBalancer, you would need to configure and maintain traffic rules separately for each one. This can become complex and time-consuming, especially as the number of services grows, compared to managing all traffic rules centrally through a single Ingress.

- Ingress: Consolidates traffic management in one place, simplifying the configuration and maintenance of routing rules. This centralization is particularly beneficial for managing large applications with many services.

4. SSL Termination

   - LoadBalancer: Typically, SSL termination (decrypting HTTPS traffic) would need to be configured for each LoadBalancer separately.
   - Ingress: Allows you to centralize SSL termination, managing certificates and HTTPS traffic at a single ingress point.

5. Path-Based Routing

   - LoadBalancer: Does not inherently support path-based routing (e.g., routing example.com/api to one service and example.com/web to another).
   - Ingress: Enables path-based routing, allowing you to serve different parts of your application from different services using the same domain.

6. Host-Based Routing

   LoadBalancer: Does not support routing based on the host header (e.g., routing api.example.com to one service and web.example.com to another).
   Ingress: Easily handles host-based routing, making it easier to manage applications with multiple subdomains or domains.

7. Scalability and Flexibility

   - LoadBalancer: Less flexible in handling complex traffic patterns and scaling.
   - Ingress: Provides a more scalable solution by allowing more sophisticated routing, better integration with cloud-native traffic management tools, and easier updates as your application grows.

## Introducing the Ingress object kind

When you want to expose a set of services externally, you create an Ingress object and reference the Service objects in it. Kubernetes uses this Ingress object to configure an L7 load balancer (an HTTP reverse proxy) that makes the services accessible to external clients through a common entrypoint.

`NOTE`

If you expose a Service through an Ingress, you can usually leave the Service type set to ClusterIP

### Exposing services through an Ingress object

</p

The Ingress object contains rules for routing traffic to the three services based on the information in the HTTP request. The public DNS entries for the services all point to the same Ingress. The Ingress determines which service should receive the request from the request itself. If the client request specifies the host kiada.example.com, the Ingress forwards it to the pods that belong to the kiada service, whereas requests that specify the host api.example.com are forwarded to the quote or quiz services, depending on which path is requested.

### Using multiple Ingress objects in a cluster

An Ingress object typically handles traffic for all Service objects in a particular Kubernetes namespace, but multiple Ingresses are also an option. Normally, each Ingress object gets its own IP address, but some ingress implementations use a shared entrypoint for all Ingress objects you create in the cluster.

## Introducing the Ingress controller and the reverse proxy

### Understanding the role of the ingress controller

**Before anything else, understand the meaning of a reverse proxy**

The main role of a reverse proxy is to route incoming requests to the appropriate service based on defined rules.

</p

The Ingress controller is the software component that activates the Ingress object. It connects to the Kubernetes API server and monitors the Ingress, Service, and Endpoints or EndpointSlice objects. Whenever these objects are created, modified, or deleted, the controller is notified. It uses this information to provision and configure the reverse proxy for the Ingress.

</p

When you create the Ingress object, the controller reads its spec section and combines it with the information in the Service and EndpointSlice objects it references. The controller converts this information into the configuration for the reverse proxy. It then sets up a new proxy with this configuration and performs additional steps to ensure that the proxy is reachable from outside the cluster. If the proxy is running in a pod inside the cluster, this usually means that a LoadBalancer type service is created to expose the proxy externally.

### Understanding how the proxy forwards traffic to the services

The reverse proxy (or L7 load balancer) is the component that handles incoming HTTP requests and forwards it to the services. The proxy configuration typically contains a list of virtual hosts and, for each, a list of endpoint IPs. This information is obtained from the Ingress, Service, and Endpoints/EndpointSlice objects. When clients connect to the proxy, the proxy uses this information to route the request to an endpoint such as a pod based on the request path and headers.

The following figure shows how a client accesses the Kiada service through the proxy. The client first performs a DNS lookup of kiada.example.com. The DNS server returns the public IP address of the reverse proxy. Then the client sends an HTTP request to the proxy where the Host header contains the value kiada.example.com. The proxy maps this host to the IP address of one of the Kiada pods and forwards the HTTP request to it. Note that the proxy doesnâ€™t send the request to the service IP, but directly to the pod. This is how most ingress implementations work.

## Installing an ingress controller

There are many different ingress implementations to choose from. They all provide the type of traffic routing explained in the previous section, but each provides different additional features. In all the examples in this chapter
