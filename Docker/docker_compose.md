## Overview About docker-compose file

A docker-compose.yml file is a configuration file used by Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container Docker applications.Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. With a single configuration file, you can specify all the services (containers) your application needs, and Docker Compose will take care of starting and managing them for you.

## Key Concepts of Docker Compose

- version: Specifies the version of the Compose file format. Different versions support different features.

- Services: Each service represents a container. You define the container's image, environment variables, volumes, ports, and other settings within each service.

- Networks: Networks allow communication between different services. Docker Compose sets up a default network for your services, but you can also define custom networks.

- Volumes: Volumes allow you to persist data between container restarts. They can be used to share files and directories between the host and containers or between multiple containers.

- Configuration: You can set environment variables, specify dependencies, and configure other settings for your services.

## Basic Structure of a Docker Compose File

```yml
version: "3.8" # Specify the Compose file format version

services: # Define the services (containers)
  service_name:
    image: someimage:tag # Specify the Docker image to use
    ports: # Define port mappings
      - "host_port:container_port"
    environment: # Set environment variables
      - VARIABLE=value
    volumes: # Define volumes for persistent storage
      - host_path:container_path
    networks: # Specify networks for communication
      - network_name
    depends_on: # Specify dependencies between services
      - other_service_name

networks: # Define custom networks
  network_name:

volumes: # Define named volumes
  volume_name:
```
