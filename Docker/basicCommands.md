How to install docker

## Command for Containers(`container`)

1. List containers

   ```bash
   # This command lists all containers, including running, stopped, and exited containers.
   docker ps -a
   # it shows containers that are currently active and running.
   docker container ls
   docker ps
   ```

2. Start a new container

   ```bash
    # to run a new container
    docker run --name name-of-your-container image-name
    # -i (interactive): Keeps the standard input (stdin) open for the container, allowing you to interact with it.
    # -t (tty): Allocates a pseudo-TTY, which gives you a terminal interface. This is what makes the interactive shell possible.
    docker run -it ubuntu bash
   ```

3. Start a container that was started before

   ```bash
   docker start name-of-your-container

   # To open an interactive bash session for a specific container, use this command:
   docker start -ai name-of-your-container
   ```

4. Stop a container

   ```bash
   # to stop container
   docker stop {Container ID} or {name}
   ```

5. Remove a container

   ```bash
   docker container rm {Container ID} or {name}
   ```

6. Execute a command for a running container

   ```bash
    # to run command in specific container use this command:
    docker exec {CONTAINER ID, NAMES} your_command_that_you_want
    #  to open a bash shell inside the container:
    docker exec -it {CONTAINER ID, NAMES}
    docker exec -it name-of-your-container /bin/bash
   ```

7. To show

   ```bash
   # The docker inspect command is used to retrieve detailed information about Docker objects, such as containers, images, networks, and volumes. It provides a JSON output that contains configuration and status details for the specified object.
   docker inspect ubuntu
   ```

8. Remove all stopped containers

   ```bash
   docker container prune
   ```

9. `attach` Command

   The attach command in Linux, particularly in the context of Docker, is used to connect your terminal to a running container. This allows you to view the output and interact with the container directly.

   ```bash
   docker attach {CONTAINER ID, NAME}
   ```

10. Port Mapping

    Port mapping is a process that allows network traffic to be redirected from one port on a host machine to a different port on a container or virtual machine.

    ```bash
    docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
    ```

    - Purpose: It allows services running inside containers to be accessible from the outside world.
    - Mechanism: It maps a port on the host to a port on the container.
    - Example: If you map port 3000 on the host to port 80 on a container, accessing http://localhost:3000 on the host will redirect traffic to port 80 on the container, where a service (like a web server) is running.

    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:80 nginx
    ```

- The `-p` flag in the docker run command is used to publish a container's port or a range of ports to the host. It essentially maps the specified port(s) on the host to the specified port(s) on the container.

11. Important flags

- `-d` flag:<br>
  Run containers in the background to allow multiple containers to run simultaneously without keeping the terminal session busy, ensuring your terminal remains free for other commands and operations while still allowing access to the container's logs using docker logs <container_id_or_name> to see what’s happening inside the container.

## Command for images(`image`)

1. Run image

   ```bash
   # creates and starts a new container from the specified image and downloads the image from Docker Hub if it does not already exist locally.
   docker run image-name
   ```

2. Pull Image

   ```bash
   # to get image without run it use this command
   docker pull author_name/image_name:version(by default-> latest)
   ```

3. List images

   ```bash
   docker images
   docker image ls
   ```

4. Remove image
   ```bash
   docker image rm {REPOSITORY} or {IMAGE ID}
   docker rmi {REPOSITORY} or {IMAGE ID}
   ```
5. Build Image

   ```bash
   # If your Dockerfile is named Dockerfile and is in the current directory, you can simply use:

   docker build -t my_own_image .

   # If the Dockerfile is named something else, for example, MyDockerfile, you should use:

   docker build -f MyDockerfile -t my_own_image .
   ```

`curl`

curl is a command-line tool in Linux used for transferring data to or from a server using various protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It is widely used for interacting with web APIs, downloading files, and testing server endpoints.

```bash
docker exec hardcore_perlman curl localhost:80
```

## to override environment variables use this command in :

```bash
-e variable_name=value
```

## Network Command:

- Type of network when you run a container and you can create a network and use it by its name.

  1.  Bridge Network:

      - Default network for containers if no other network is specified.
      - Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other using their IP addresses or container names.
      - Suitable for standalone applications.

      ```bash
      # create new network
      docker network create my-bridge-network
      docker run --network my-bridge-network my-container
      # create new network with some details
      docker network create \–-driver bridge \-–subnet 182.18.0.0/16
      custom-isolated-network
      # Purpose:
      # This command creates a custom bridge network named custom-isolated-network with a specified subnet of 182.18.0.0/16. Containers connected to this network can communicate with each other using IP addresses within this subnet range. This setup is useful for isolating groups of containers and managing their network configurations.
      ```

  2.  Host Network:

      - Containers use the host’s network stack directly.
      - No network isolation between the container and the host.
      - Suitable for high-performance or low-latency requirements.

      ```bash
      docker run --network host my-container
      ```

  3.  None Network:

      - Containers are isolated from all networks.
      - Suitable for security or testing purposes where network access is not needed.

      ```bash
      docker run --network none my-container
      ```

- To list all networks in Docker

```bash
docker network ls
```

## Storage Command:

- `create volume`

  ```bash
  docker volume create data_volume
  ```

- `list all volumes`

  ```bash
  docker volume ls
  ```

- `get details of the specific volume`

  ```bash
  docker volume inspect volume_name
  ```

- `remove volume`

  ```bash
  docker rm volume_name
  ```
