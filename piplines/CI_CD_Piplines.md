# what is CI/CD Pipelines?

A CI/CD pipeline is a set of automated processes that streamline the steps involved in developing, testing, and deploying software.

Pipelines are a powerful tool for automating various stages of the software development lifecycle, not just deployment.

- CI (Continuous Integration) involves automatically integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository several times a day. This process includes automated testing to ensure that new code doesn't introduce bugs or break the existing codebase.

- CD (Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment) extends CI by automating the deployment of code changes to staging or production environments. In Continuous Delivery, the code is always in a deployable state, but deployment to production may still require manual approval. In Continuous Deployment, every code change that passes the automated tests is automatically deployed to production, without human intervention.

# What is a Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to build, test, and deploy software. It is widely used for implementing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) practices.

**A high-level explanation of how Jenkins deploys an application from a GitHub repository and handles changes:**

- `Integration with GitHub`: Jenkins is configured to integrate with GitHub through a plugin or webhook. This setup allows Jenkins to be notified of changes in the GitHub repository.

- `Triggering Builds`: When a change (like a new commit or pull request) is pushed to the GitHub repository, Jenkins receives a notification via a webhook or periodic polling. This triggers a Jenkins job or pipeline to start.

- `Cloning the Repository`: Jenkins updates its local workspace by pulling the latest changes from the GitHub repository. This ensures that Jenkins works with the most recent code. Instead of re-cloning the entire repository, Jenkins fetches only the new changes and updates.

- `Building the Application`: Jenkins performs the build process defined in the pipeline or job configuration. This may involve compiling code, running tests, creating artifacts, or packaging the application.

- `Deploying the Application`: After the build process completes successfully, Jenkins deploys the application. This might involve pushing Docker images to a container registry, deploying code to a server, or other deployment activities as specified in the pipeline.

- `Handling Changes`: Each time there's a change in the GitHub repository, Jenkins re-executes the pipeline from the beginning. It checks out the updated code, rebuilds the application, and redeploys it if necessary. This ensures that the latest changes are always reflected in the deployed application.

# What is a Github Actions?

GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repositories. It provides a way to define and execute custom automation tasks like Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and other repetitive processes related to your software development lifecycle.

**Key Features of GitHub Actions:**

- `Workflows`: Defined in YAML files within your repository, workflows specify the steps to be executed, such as building, testing, and deploying your code.

- `Events`: Workflows can be triggered by various events, including pushes, pull requests, issues, and scheduled times.

- `Jobs`: Each workflow consists of one or more jobs, which are individual tasks that run on specified runners (virtual machines or containers).

- `Actions`: Reusable units of code that perform specific tasks within jobs. You can use existing actions from the GitHub Marketplace or create your own.

- `Runners`: The machines that execute the workflows. GitHub provides hosted runners, or you can set up self-hosted runners.

- `Secrets and Environment Variables`: Securely manage sensitive data and environment-specific configurations required for your workflows.

# What is the difference between Jenkins and GitHub Actions?

Jenkins is a more general-purpose automation server that provides extensive flexibility and plugin support but requires more setup and maintenance.

GitHub Actions is a more streamlined, GitHub-native solution that simplifies workflow automation directly within GitHub repositories with easy configuration and integration.
